    <h3>Aout Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi my name is Promise Ignatius, I'm a Professional Photographer but i have
      since longed to explore myself with critical thinking and logical related
      problems then i came across this amazing program by DCTP. I'm currently
      following a career path in software development (backend) with my skill
      set in <b>Artifical Inteligence and Machine Learning.</b> As i hope and
      work towards advancing in knowledge and skils in software development, i employ you to journey
      with me.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>The training with DCTP by AltSchool has been great and enlightening, as we have covered a couple of topics like:</p>
    
    <!-- items lists -->
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to Computer Science</li>
        <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>And many more to come...</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>My Goals for DCTP Diploma Course</h3>
     <p>As i have always dreamed of having a problem solving hub for young people like me, 
        my goal is that after this 6 months program, i will be able build a fully functioning
        App and Website that will offer support and help to young people with mental 
        health issues giving them a real-time therapy session and also recommending 
        the appropraite medical Institutes to go for check ups. This i know that 
        cannot be done or achieved by an individual, but i believe that with the 
        course of time many brillant minds and Co-orperations will join in this 
        course and this way we can foster resilence and growth in our country Nigeria.</p>
